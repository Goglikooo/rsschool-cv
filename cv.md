## __About myself:__  

I'm 27-years-old dreamer, who's dream always was to find himself. After experimenting with nearly _everything_, at the age of 25 I realised how interesting coding was and how unlimited its boundaries were. I started learning __HTML__ and __CSS__ in 2020 by myself from [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) and continued learning since. In order to deepen my knowledge, I decided to enroll myself into __IT-Academy__ and still studying there to improve my skills as a Front-End Developer. Besides, I started taking classes from [The Rolling Scopes School](https://rollingscopes.com/) where I am challenged with day-to-day tasks that improve my abilities to code and increase motivation to continue learning. Currently I'm working for a company called __Majorel__, where I'm a manager of 15 Customer Service Agents who operate in German Language and do the outsorsing work for a partnered worldwide-known brand. I'm always eager to learn more and will do _everyting_ to achive my goals of becomming a professional and respectful __Front-end Developer__.
